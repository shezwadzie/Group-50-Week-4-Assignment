## Q1: How do AI code generators like GitHub Copilot reduce development time? What are their limitations?

**Benefits:**
- Predicts and autocompletes functions and code blocks.
- Saves time writing boilerplate code.
- Increases developer productivity and speeds up prototyping.

**Limitations:**
- May generate incorrect or insecure code.
- Doesn’t understand specific business logic or intent.
- Relies heavily on training data and may repeat bias/errors.

## Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning for Bug Detection

- **Supervised Learning**:  
  Trained with labeled data like `bug` or `no bug`.  
  Useful when past examples of bugs exist.

- **Unsupervised Learning**:  
  Works without labels. Groups or clusters similar behavior.  
  Useful when we don’t have labeled bug data — helps detect unknown issues.

## Q3: Why is bias mitigation important in AI for personalization?

- AI personalization systems can reinforce harmful biases.
- Might ignore minority users or overfit to certain demographics.
- Fairness tools help avoid discrimination and build inclusive software.

## Case Study: AIOps in DevOps – Automating Deployment Pipelines

**How AIOps Improves Deployment:**

1. **Anomaly Detection**  
   AIOps detects abnormal system behavior early by scanning logs and metrics.  
   This prevents issues before deployment.

2. **Automated Root Cause Analysis**  
   AI tools analyze incidents and suggest fixes or rollback points.  
   This speeds up recovery time and reduces manual debugging.
