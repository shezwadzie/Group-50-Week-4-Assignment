Manual testing requires repeatedly inputting credentials and observing the outcome, which becomes time-consuming and error-prone as applications grow. By using Selenium, we automated this process and ran both valid and invalid login cases without touching the keyboard after writing the script.

Selenium handles DOM interactions quickly and consistently, reducing human error and saving developer time. Additionally, the automated script can be reused in continuous integration pipelines, ensuring that login functionality is always tested before updates are pushed.

Compared to manual testing, AI-driven tools like Testim.io offer even more advantages â€” auto-detecting elements, self-healing selectors, and a visual interface for non-coders. However, Selenium offers full control for developers and doesnâ€™t rely on a paid service.

In conclusion, automated testing (whether with Selenium or AI tools) significantly improves speed, reliability, and confidence during software development.
